# PeonPing Registry

The central index of [CESP](https://peonping.com/spec) sound packs. Metadata only -- no audio files stored here.

Browse packs at [peonping.com/packs](https://peonping.com/packs).

## How it works

The file `index.json` at the repo root is the single source of truth for all registered packs. Each pack entry contains flattened metadata pointing to the pack's source repository. There are no per-pack subdirectories; everything lives in `index.json`.

**Index URL:** `https://PeonPing.github.io/registry/index.json`

## Submit a pack

1. Create a GitHub repo with your pack (e.g., `yourname/peonping-mypack`)
2. Include `peonping.json` manifest + `sounds/` directory
3. Tag a release: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
4. Fork this repo and add your entry to the `packs` array in `index.json` (keep alphabetical order by `name`)
5. Open a PR -- CI will validate your entry automatically

See the full guide at [peonping.com/create](https://peonping.com/create).

## Registry entry format

Each entry in the `packs` array looks like this:

```json

  "author": { "name": "yourname", "github": "yourname" },
